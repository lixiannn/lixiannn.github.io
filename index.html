                    <p>Hi! 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am Li Xian, a Year 2 undergraduate studying Double Degree Business & Computing at Nanyang 
                        Technological University. As a computing student, I have been exposed to various programming languages 
                        such as python, Java and C etc and also core computing concepts such as algorithm and data structures. 
                        In my business classes, I have learnt about various business operations and analytical skills. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As the world faces immense amount of challenges brought about by COVID-19, the need for digital transformation
                        has become even more pressing todat. Accelerating this process can help businesses as well as individuals to 
                        navigate through this trying time, and I am eager to contribute towards this transformation. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am excited to apply what I have learnt and I look forward to be a part of your team!
